# Reptor: AI-Powered Personal Trainer

Reptor is a privacy-first mobile workout application that uses on-device computer vision to provide real-time posture correction.

## 📱 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React Native, Expo
- **UI & Style**: Uniwind, React Native Reusables
- **Pose Estimation**: Blazepose / MoveNet on TFLite
- **Evaluation Logic**: [`@royng163/reptor-core`](https://github.com/royng163/reptor-core)

## 🏗 Architecture

Reptor follows a **Teacher-Student** knowledge distillation architecture:

1.  **Teacher (Offline)**: High-capacity Python models analyze complex temporal patterns to generate ground-truth quality scores and error labels.
2.  **Distillation**: These insights are converted into lightweight, interpretable rules (thresholds, weights) and a Tiny Scorer model.
3.  **Student (This App)**: Runs locally on the phone. It executes the distilled rules against real-time landmarks from Blazepose to provide instant feedback.

### Key Modules

- **Vision Pipeline**: Captures camera frames and runs Blazepose inference.
- **Rule Engine**: Consumes `rule_config.json` to check for errors (e.g., "Knees caving in").
- **Feedback UI**: Renders corrective cues overlaying the camera feed.
